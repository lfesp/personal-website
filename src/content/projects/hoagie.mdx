Hoagie is a creative space that fosters community-centered design and implementation of digital experiences for students at Princeton University &#8212; we like to think of ourselves as a non-stop hackathon.
Through coworking sessions, collaborative projects, and discussions on UI/UX design and softare engineering, Hoagie promotes friendly collaboration and creative cross-pollination across its members.
Over the years, as Vice-President and (subsequently) President, I helped build Hoagie's first kilelr apps and led the team through a transition from a project-based development team to a more open-ended community for student builders. 

In the summer of 2021, I worked to help design, develop, and launch Hoagie Mail, a web app allowing students to send and schedule campus-wide email announcements, which has been used by over 4,000 unique users since launch and currently sends >400 emails per day. 
Following the app's pseudo-viral success on Princeton's campus, Hoagie -- at that point a collective of student programmers working on projects for third-party clients -- 
reinvented itself as an organized team building an integrated application platform for students, which today includes an online bullitin board, email digest service, and apps for course reviews and scheduling.
