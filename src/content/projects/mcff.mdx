Mercer County Free Food Finder (prev. Trenton Food Finder) is a web application that aims to help New Jersey residents find free food resources by providing
an easily-accessible online directory of food distribution sites in their area. Developed as a final project for COS 333, Advanced Programming Techniques, this application was created by three then-sophomore students --
Roosevelt Scaggs, Amir Touil, and myself -- in response to a request made by a local nonprofit organization.
This organization, the Trenton Health Team, was our client and collaborator for the project, which we designed to
suit their particular needs as a community health care collaborative.

The directory features advanced search functionality on food resource name and multiple filter types,
and allows users to view the directory of food resources in multiple forms: as a scrollable list of data entries,
as markers on an interactive map, as a printable table, and as entries on a synced Google calendar.
In addition, the application provides a comprehensive interface for the administration of the directory, including
site archival, bulk editing, complex calendar recurrence scheduling, basic usage analytics data collection and export,
and permissions management for third-party administrator accounts with site-level granularity of selective edit privileges.
