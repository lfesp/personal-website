Berry was a startup venture seeking to streamline the online grocery shopping experience for those with
nutrition-reliant health needs by means of a digital shopping assistant. As the founding engineer at Berry from Jun&ndash;Nov 2021, my responsibilities included the development
of our primary product, a Google Chrome extension that performs personalized nutritional analysis on online shopping sites, the construction of static
webpages for the company, the creation of Berry's brand identity, and the design of UI prototypes for the extension and web application.

Sponsored by Princeton University's Keller Center for Entrepreneurship, Berry was one of the seven student ventures
selected by the University to participate in the 10-week eLab Startup Accelerator program during the summer of 2021, over which course I gained a concrete foundation of entrepreneurial skills
and knowledge through advising with veterans of venture capital and our own experiences in marketing, outreach, development, and financing.
