Digworld was a fun little project made in collaboration with [Luke Shannon](https://www.lukeshannon.xyz/)
as an exploration into using modifiable scalar fields and the marching cubes algorithm to create a 
destructible/dynamic terrain system. This small game/sandbox was made using three.js and was heavily inspired
by the work of [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague).
