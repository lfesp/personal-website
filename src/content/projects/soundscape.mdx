For our electronic and computer music programming final, my group built an interactive sound art piece
controlled by live electroencephalogram (EEG) data streamed in from a headset worn by the listener.
Written primarily in Max MSP, the piece consists of four distinct soundscapes, each independently responsive to 
fluctuations in the intensity of activity in the listener's Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta EEG bands. The 
listener is able to transition between these various soundscapes by attaining and holding steady on target focus states while guided
(or interfered with) by the qualities of the sounds themselves.

Special thanks to Leila Hudson for her collaboration and acquisition/setup of the EEG equipment, without which this project would not have been possible.
