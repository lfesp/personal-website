### *description
In between the allotted daily walks of Princeton University's spring 2021 arrival quarantine, I took a head-first dive into React development by building this personal website as my first web development project.
Over the preceding winter break, I had begun to teach myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript out of curiosity.
So, when faced with the boredom of being shut in my dorm room for a week, I decided to prepare for the then-upcoming development stage of Hoagie's Tiger Mazagine project by applying these new skills to learn all about React, static site generation, SEO, and deployment.

### *tech overview
Built on **Gatsby** and autodeployed from GitHub on **Netlify**, this website is served as fast as a static site while retaining the modularity of a React application thanks to the **Jamstack** architecture. Although this little site doesn't _really_ need much more than a few static HTML pages, 
using a **React** framework made development super smooth and allowed me to use all sorts of fun libraries, like gatsby-plugin-image's lazy-loading and blur-up for image optimization.

In its current state, this site generates project pages like this one from **MDX** files pulled locally using a **GraphQL** query, though I intend to soon migrate to a headless CMS like Contentful.
When it comes to styling, I elected to use **SASS**. Having come from vanilla CSS, I originally found it quite nice for this site's simple global styling, but I've since grown to favor the more modular approach of, _well_, CSS-Modules and CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components.
