### *description
Hoagie is a creative space that fosters community-centered design and implementation of digital experiences for students at Princeton University &#8212; we like to think of ourselves as a non-stop hackathon. 
Through discussions on UI/UX design and modern web development technologies, Hoagie promotes friendly collaboration and creative cross-pollination across its various project sub-teams.
As **Director of Design and Development**, I'm leading the creation of Hoagie's ambitious primary project for the 2021-2022 school year: an integrated application platform for student web apps, 
built with **Next.js** and powered by a Hoagie-made, **Golang**-built RESTful API for student data. In the summer of 2021, I worked to help design, develop, and launch Hoagie Mail, the first application in Hoagie's integrated system. 
In the month since its September launch, **Hoagie Mail** has quickly become the primary means of sending email announcements on Princeton's campus, now used to send over 75% of university-wide emails by individuals, independent student groups, 
and academic department committees alike. 
Prior Hoagie projects have included a redesign and rebuild of Tiger Magazine's website and a template system for the course websites of Princeton University's Computer Science Department.
