### *description
Berry is a startup venture seeking to streamline the online grocery shopping experience for those with
nutrition-reliant health needs by means of a **digital shopping assistant**.
Sponsored by Princeton University's Keller Center for Entrepreneurship, Berry was one of the seven student ventures 
selected by the University to participate in the 10-week **eLab Startup Accelerator** program during the summer of 2021.
Over the course of this program, myself and the other four starting team members gained a concrete foundation of entrepreneurial skills
 and knowledge through advising with veterans of venture capital and our own experiences in marketing, outreach, development, and financing.
At Berry, I began serving as **Chief Technical Officer** in June 2021, and since then my responsibilities have included the development
of our primary product, a Google Chrome extension that performs personalized nutritional analysis on online shopping sites, the construction of static
webpages for our company, the creation of Berry's current brand identity, as well as the design of UI prototypes for the extension and web application.
